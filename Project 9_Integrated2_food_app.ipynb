    "Purposes of the analysis are to find out the event funnel, determine how users reach the purchase stage and then to perform A/A/B test to investigate whether the change in design of the fonts for the entire application has an influence to users behavior.\n",
    "First we should study the sales funnel. Find out how users reach the purchase stage and define how many users actually make it to this stage, how many users get stuck at previous stages.\n",
    "Then interpret the results of an A/A/B tests. The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the users might find the new design intimidating. The analysis should help to make a decision based on the results of the following A/A/B test- the users are splited into three groups. Two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. Creating two A groups has certain advantages. We can make it a principle that we will only be confident in the accuracy of our testing when the two control groups are similar. If there are significant differences between the A groups, this can help us uncover factors that may be distorting the results. \n"
